## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate and driven software developer with a strong foundation in modern web technologies. I'm currently pursuing Web and Computer Programming and Web Development certificates at **Brigham Young University–Idaho** through the **BYU–Pathway Worldwide** program.

My journey into software development began from a deep curiosity about how technology shapes the world around us. Over time, I have developed a particular interest in building scalable, user-friendly web applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems with code, and I'm constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and best practices.

I specialize in using **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **C#**. I have hands-on experience developing projects like an e-commerce web app, creating optimized content for digital marketing, and managing structured data for contract-based companies.

### 🔍 Interests & Goals:
- Building intuitive, performant web applications
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Learning backend development with Node.js and MongoDB
- Enhancing my understanding of full-stack software architecture
- Collaborating with developers and contributing to meaningful software projects
- Leveraging technology to create opportunities for communities in Uganda and beyond

Whether it’s crafting efficient UI, optimizing code for speed, or mentoring others on their coding journey, I aim to grow both as a developer and as a person of impact.
